#Tasks performed this week:

1. Extracted data from the CDC FluView Interactive portal
(https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html)

2. Specifically used cases reported to ILINET system by each state.

3. Cleaned data to report flu cases by state for the years 2016-2019.

4. Uploaded cleaned data to project database

5. Developed a linear regression machine learning model to evaluate the 
possibility of linear relationship between the percentage of people uninsured 
per state to the number of flu cases per state for each year starting with 
2016 and ending with 2019.

6. Began developing multi-linear regression model for the combination of
population, gdp, and uninsured rate per state vs the flu cases per state for 
each year starting in 2016 and ending in 2019.

7. Developed framework for the group presentation.

8. Recleaned flu data to look at flu cases as percentage of population of
